> *LLMs where used to review the structure and improve the formulation of some of the sentences in this post.*

When seeing the date when this was posted, you might ask yourself why one would decide to start his own homepage/blog on Christmas out of all dates? Well, for various I had a lot of time to think about this in the last weeks weeks and today i finally have an opportunity to execute on it.

With this first post, I simply want to start writing a post. It will include some thoughts I have on my mind, some background on why I start with this and what I expect it to look like.


## What to expect?

Firstly: I want to keep it relatively simple, to not succumb to (my own) unrealistic expectations. I want to get a feel on how much I enjoy it and if I can see me doing this not only for a few weeks but rather for the long run. Therefore, I do not expect every post to be polished.

For now I have 3 different types of posts in mind:
- **"Learning Notes"**: Unstructured posts where I digest things that I recently learned.
- **"Reading Notes"**: Comments on other blogposts, with my thoughts and comments on them.
- **"General Posts"**: Essentially everything else that I might want to write about.

Ofcourse, this list will probably expand over time (e.g. I can already see something like "Working Notes" coming up), but I want to keep expectations low for the sake of my own motivation.

Secondly, I will focus on the topics of AI in all its forms, but mostly on LLMs. I am interested in all topics from end to end, e.g. model training, AI applciation building and engineering, agentic coding, AI adoption in companies, economic aspects, and so one and so on... Other topics that I am working on include software (and possible product) engineering, solution architecture and everything related to this. 

To understand more please read more on [my motivation below](#my-motivation).

## A note on the use of LLMs

For me there are broadly two ways I see LLMs being used for writing posts.
1. If I see a post where I can tell in the first few sentences that major parts of it are probably written by AI (I am looking at you em dash, or the typical "It is not only... It is a..."), I usually stop reading because the chance that the post lacking substance is relatively high. After having spend so much time working with LLMs, there are some [Signs of AI Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) which one can just spot immediately. These post often lack substance and authenticity, leaving you with a feeling of not having gained anything of it expect spending (valuable) time one it. While this may be fine for the creator, I do not think it is fair to the reader.
2. Texts with the motivation of giving genuine ideas, which e.g. bring something new to the table or give a different perspective on a topic. This is in contrast to creating "output" just for the sake of creating "output". When reading those, you can feel that the author had something specific he wanted to tell in his "voice"/way. LLMs may have been used but rather to support and refine the ideas of the author, not to replace them.

Naturally, there are shades of grey to to this. I do believe though, that in the future, the quantity of AI-generated content will only increase and may even become the norm. But at the same time, I am sure that the value of human created content with an authentic humanc voice will increase just as much. [I am not the only one who has come to this conclusion](https://dejan.ai/blog/report-ai-workplace).

So what does that mean for me an my blog? I promised I would not overcomplicate this:
1. I will use LLMs to make my life easier as I do not see this an excercise in writing but rather in sticking to something and expressing my thoughts. As a non-native speaker, it will help me improve formulations and help my express the concepts and ideas in my head. I will even use them for research, drafting, brainstorming or other things. But what is important to me: **The core of my texts will be my thoughts, using my personal voice**
2. To make it easier for my (hypothetical) readers to understand what to expect from my posts, I will do something I would love to see when I am reading other peoples posts: **I will be transparent about the degree of AI used in my posts, by including a disclaimer at the beginning of each post**. One example of this can be seen at the beginning of this post.


## My Motivation

**Challenging my "Read Later" habits:** I am typical hoarder, when it comes to reading resources like blog posts or articles (thank you Youtube "Watch Later" for teaching me this sin). Unfortunately I only rarely find the time to read and especially digest them. Sometimes I just read them just for the sake of not feeling bad of them rotting in my read later list. But that lead to me to in many cases only reading them superficially and not actually engaging with what I am reading. This feels like a waste of time and energy. 

If I have learned one thing from the great course ["Learning how to Learn"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), it is that writing things down is a phenomenal way to understand and get better at something. Writing posts is therefore a way to encourage myself to not only read but also to think about the stuff I read .


**Challenging my Self-Marketing aversion:** While writing down things just for the sake of learning or personal development is great (and would be sufficient on its own for me), there is another thing that motivated me to make it public. I know that I am not good at adequately presenting myself and the work that I have done. I am lucky to be in an environment, where friends and colleaques that know me well are honest (but still kind) enough to give me a hint from time to time, that I am underselling myself.

I prefer my work and presence to speak for itself rather than polishing it to look better than it actually is (some might call this the "LinkedIn/CV game). In the past weeks I have come to recognize though that there is a viable middle ground between shameless self-marketing and doing nothing for ones own professional presence. One way to achieve this is creating publicly available artifacts that demonstrate interests, expertise and experience. In other words: a blog where I can show of my portfolio. So I want to train my "artifact generating skills", so things I can point to say: "I have done that, that was good".


**Open up future work opportunities:**
It is no secret that that the current IT market is tense, especially for juniors (which you might classify me as if you only go by years of experience). I believe now more than every it is beneficial to show a clear expertise profile to not drown in the pool of applicants. Being able to show a history of learning and interesting projects is a great tool that could help me show my expertise and fit. I think this is especially relevant in the AI space, where a huge number of people are storming into the technology from vastly different angles. I want to be able to provide a proven track record which demonstrates my deep expertise even before I had the first in-person exchange with any recruiters (which is where I am feel more confident at).
